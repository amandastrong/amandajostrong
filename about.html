				<section class="about">
					<p>Let me introduce myself. My name is Amanda Strong and I am currently a graduate student at Northwestern University’s School of Communication.</p>

					<p> I am a problem solver who has lived their life thinking outside of the box, using my unique background and talents to find creative and innovative solutions to problems both big and small. I have studied everything from engineering to communications and public relations, giving myself a unique perspective on the world around me. I love a good challenge, and have always found myself torn between my passion for both the arts and science.</p>

					<p> While pursuing my MS in Leadership in Creative Enterprises at Northwestern University, I have learned how to merge my left brain with my right, putting both my technical knowledge and business savvy to use in creative environments.</p>

					<h1> EXPERIENCE </h1>
						<h2> Event Coordinator- <i> Northwest Museum of Arts & Culture, March 2013-June 2015 </i></h2>
							<p>I was equal parts project manager and volunteer coordinator, responsible for planning and teaching children’s art activities in the Make it Art! children’s art tent, in addition to finding, training, and managing event volunteers.  I worked closely with the ArtFest General Manager to market, staff, and rebrand the children’s area, revitalizing community interest and streamlining performance while meeting the museum’s mission of actively engaging people in appreciation of the arts and culture.</p>
							<p>Prior to my role as Event Coordinator, I acted as a communication and design intern and provided event assistance and sales support at various museum events.  As a design intern, I developed a weekly internal newsletters circulated to both the MAC’s Staff and the Board of Trustees.  Collaborating with museum staff, I regularly designed and developed event posters, promotional flyers, brochures, and other marketing materials to promote MAC programs and events, while also performing various front desk and office duties. </p>

						<h2> Communication & Social Media Intern- <i> Partnering for Progress (NPO), 2014 - 2015 </i></h2>
							<p> I worked closely with the Executive Director and Communication Committee chair to develop a comprehensive social media plan in order to increase P4P’s online presence and expand their audience reach.  I leveraged the non-profit’s powerful mission and expansive photo library with integrated marketing campaigns across multiple platforms to engage target audiences and reach out to potential donors and volunteers.  In addition to managing their social media accounts from January – May of 2015, I acted as P4P’s volunteer coordinator and sat on both their Event and Communication Committees.  While at P4P, I helped to plan fundraising campaigns and generate promotional materials such as flyers, brochures, and digital banners and ads, in addition to contributing to their monthly newsletter. </p>

						<h2> Midterm Election Data Entry Clerk- <i> Associated Press Spokane, November 4-5, 2014 </i></h2>
							<p> I directly reported district voting into the AP’s Election Database to be broadcast across the country.  This high stress, fast paced job continued the following morning during “Next Day Chase” where I was tasked with verifying data from the previous night by calling and speaking with county clerks. </p>

						<h2> Lead Summer Staff- <i> Boys and Girls Club of Spokane, Summer 2014 & 2015 </i></h2>
							<p> As Pre-Teen staff Lead, I acted as a child-care provider, taught art and leadership activities to children between the ages of 5 – 18, and acted as a liaison between the club director and Pre-Teen staff. </p>
					
						<h2> Freelance Web Design- <i>Current Hobby </i></h2>
							<p> As a freelance Web Designer, I have designed websites for small businesses and individuals (including this one), working closely with clients to create and maintain their personal and professional brands online, generating both written and photographic content, and maintaining general site upkeep.
